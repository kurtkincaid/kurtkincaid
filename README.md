Kurt Kincaid

Cryptographic engineer, security engineer, and coder. Listed as the inventor on U.S. Patent #10,187,375 (Cryptographic Services Engine). Extensive background in cryptography, PKI, log aggregation, data visualization, data analysis, Linux administration, and I accidentally made a career for myself by writing code that makes Thing X play nicely with Thing Y, especially when X and Y were never designed to work together or even have knowledge of the other's existence.

When I'm not wearing my IT hat, I am a martial artist (Pencak Silat, Wing Chun, Kali, Taiji Quan), writer of fiction (horror, sci-fi, and fantasy) and non-fiction (usually technical, though sometimes dealing with professional ethics), and artist (mostly graphite, though occasionally colored pencil). I have a Master of Arts in English Literature, focusing on Medieval English Literature, with secondary foci on Shakespeare and Classical Greek Drama. I am a writing/editing machine.

I am _very_ intrested in being involved in any projects that require security input (especially encryption and PKI, though any security topic is on the table), Linux, JavaScript (node.js), or Perl.

Anxious to work on existing projects or on something new entirely. I look forward to collaborating with you.

-Kurt
